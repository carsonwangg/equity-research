# 2026 Market Outlook & Hedge Fund Positioning Synthesis
*Generated: February 4, 2026*

## Part 1: Doug O'Laughlin's 2026 AI & Semiconductor Outlook

### Key Themes

**AI Infrastructure Buildout Continues**
- Data center capex continues at elevated levels, though growth rates moderate
- Custom silicon (ASICs) gaining share vs. merchant GPUs in inference workloads
- Power/energy infrastructure becoming critical bottleneck for hyperscaler expansion

**Memory Cycle Dynamics**
- HBM demand remains strong driven by AI accelerators
- DRAM pricing stabilizing after 2025 recovery
- NAND facing more challenging supply/demand balance

**Semiconductor Supply Chain**
- TSMC capacity utilization remains high for advanced nodes (3nm, 2nm)
- Geopolitical tensions continue to drive reshoring/friendshoring investments
- Equipment spending normalized but still above pre-AI cycle levels

**AI Model Evolution**
- Inference workloads growing faster than training
- Edge AI deployment accelerating
- Reasoning/agentic AI driving new compute architectures

### O'Laughlin's Key Investment Implications
- Infrastructure plays (power, networking, memory) may offer better risk/reward than GPU-centric names
- Custom silicon trend benefits companies with ASIC design capabilities
- Memory suppliers with HBM exposure remain well-positioned

## Part 5: Questions for Your Judgment

1. **On Portfolio Reinforcement:**
   - GOOGL and META continue to see broad institutional support. Does the hedge fund positioning reinforce or complicate your thesis on these names?
   - Should we do a deeper dive on META given Tiger's 63% reduction despite your bullish thesis?

2. **On New Sectors:**
   - Multiple funds (Coatue, Lone Pine) are building significant power/utility exposure (GEV, CEG, VST). Does the energy infrastructure theme for AI fit your framework? Should we pull research on these?

3. **On Semiconductor Supply Chain:**
   - Lone Pine's new AVGO position and CIEN, APH buys suggest a networking/connectivity infrastructure thesis. This aligns with O'Laughlin's custom silicon/infrastructure view. Worth exploring vs. staying closer to MU?

4. **On Hedge Fund Divergences:**
   - Tiger's complete exit from Eli Lilly and CrowdStrike is notable. Any interest in understanding the bear case on these names?
   - Atreides sold CoreWeave and Astera Labs (AI infra buildout names) aggressively. Does this signal a shift in how smart money views the AI infrastructure cycle?

*Note: Hedge fund 13F data reflects Q3 2025 (filed Nov 2025). Positions may have changed. No quarterly investor letters were found publicly available for Atreides, Coatue, or Tiger Global - these funds do not publish letters like value investors (Berkshire, Third Point, etc.).*
