# **$MU - ENHANCED EQUITY RESEARCH**

*Generated: February 4, 2026*

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**BUY** with $450 price target (35% upside) over 12 months. HBM supply shortage creates unprecedented pricing power and margin expansion. Structural shift in memory economics (AI-driven demand, supply discipline) suggests this cycle is "different and stronger for longer." High-conviction variant bet with Gavin Baker's +929% add as validation signal.

## FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS

**Recent Financial Metrics (Q1 FY2026)**
- Revenue: $13.6B (+57% YoY, +21% QoQ) — record quarter
- Non-GAAP EPS: $4.78
- Gross margin: 56.8% (massive expansion)
- DRAM revenue: $10.8B (+69% YoY)
- NAND revenue: $2.7B (+22% YoY)
- Cloud/data center revenue: $5.3B (39% of total) — record

**Q2 FY2026 Guidance**
- Revenue: $18.7B (midpoint) — +37% QoQ
- Gross margin: ~68% (midpoint) — exceptional expansion
- EPS: ~$8.42 (midpoint)

**HBM Market Position**
- HBM sold out through 2026 with multiyear LTAs locked in
- Can only meet ~60% of customer demand
- HBM TAM: $35B (2025) → $100B (2028) — 40% CAGR
- TAM arriving 2 years earlier than prior projections

**Peer Comparison**
| Metric | MU | Samsung | SK Hynix |
|--------|-----|---------|----------|
| HBM Market Share | ~25% | ~40% | ~35% |
| Gross Margin | 57% | ~35% | ~45% |
| Revenue Growth | 57% | 25% | 40% |
| HBM Capacity Expansion | Aggressive | Moderate | Aggressive |

Micron gaining share with superior HBM3E yield and customer relationships (NVIDIA validation).

## CATALYST ANALYSIS

**Near-term (0-6 months)**
- Q2 FY2026 earnings (March) — margin expansion continuation
- HBM3E 12-hi production ramp
- NVIDIA Blackwell demand visibility
- Memory pricing trajectory (spot vs contract)

**Medium-term (6-24 months)**
- Singapore HBM packaging facility launch (2026)
- Boise and Japan facilities (mid-2027, late-2028)
- 1-gamma DRAM node transition
- Potential HBM4 development announcements

**Event-driven**
- Memory industry consolidation speculation
- CHIPS Act funding disbursements
- Potential dividend initiation as FCF inflects

## VALUATION & PRICE TARGETS

**Analyst Consensus**
- KeyBanc target: $450 (raised from $325)
- Technical targets: $385-$535 (30-80% upside)
- FY27 estimates (KeyBanc): Revenue $94.4B, EPS $45.20
- Consensus FY27: Revenue $89.6B, EPS $40.88

**Scenario Analysis**
| Scenario | Price Target | Probability | Key Assumption |
|----------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Bull | $535 | 30% | HBM shortage extends to 2028, margins sustain 60%+ |
| Base | $450 | 50% | HBM demand meets expectations, margins normalize to 50% |
| Bear | $280 | 20% | Memory oversupply returns, HBM competition intensifies |

**Probability-weighted target: $450**

**Valuation Context**
- Current P/E: ~15x FY26E (cheap for growth profile)
- At $450: ~10x FY27E EPS of $45 (still reasonable)
- Memory stocks historically trade at trough multiples at peak earnings — but this cycle may be different

## RISK ASSESSMENT

**Company Risks**
- Memory cyclicality: Historical boom-bust pattern
- Execution risk: HBM yield and capacity ramp
- Customer concentration: NVIDIA dependency
- Samsung/SK Hynix competitive response
- China risk: Export restrictions, demand uncertainty

**Macro Risks**
- AI capex slowdown would crush HBM demand
- Interest rates impact on tech multiples
- Semiconductor cycle timing

**Position Sizing**
- Recommended: 2-4% of portfolio
- Beta: 1.45 (high volatility)
- Max drawdown consideration: -40% in bear scenario
- **This is a high-conviction, higher-risk position**

**ESG Considerations**
- Water usage in fab operations
- Supply chain ethics (materials sourcing)
- US manufacturing expansion (CHIPS Act alignment)

## KEY QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH

1. How sustainable is 60%+ gross margin in memory?
2. What is Samsung/SK Hynix competitive response on HBM?
3. When does HBM supply catch up to demand (2027? 2028?)?
4. Is Gavin Baker's +929% add a leading indicator or late to the trade?

---

## INVESTMENT THESIS SUMMARY

**Why This Cycle is Different:**
1. **Supply discipline**: Industry consolidated, rational behavior
2. **AI demand structural**: Not cyclical PC/smartphone driven
3. **HBM moat**: High barriers (technology, yield, customer relationships)
4. **Pricing power**: Sold out through 2026 with LTAs

**Key Monitoring Points:**
- Quarterly HBM revenue as % of total
- Gross margin sustainability
- Customer inventory levels
- Competitor capacity announcements
