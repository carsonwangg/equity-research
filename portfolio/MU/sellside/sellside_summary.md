## Key Consensus Themes

### 1. Memory Supply Tightness Extending Into 2027+
- **RBC**: "Supply likely to remain tight into 2027" - demand growing ~20% vs supply in mid-to-high-teens
- **TD Cowen**: "Shortages worsening, not improving" - narrative moved from CY26 to CY28 in ~3 months
- **Wells Fargo**: Disciplined phased capacity approach; PSMC acquisition accelerates output by 3+ years vs building new fabs
- **William Blair**: Samsung and SK Hynix both signaling supply tightness until at least 2027

### 2. HBM Leadership & TAM Expansion
- **RBC**: MU gained significant share (0% → 20%+ in ~8 quarters); HBM4 transition has 30-50% price premium
- **RBC**: HBM market CAGR of 40%+ through 2028; TAM from $35B (2025) → $100B (2028)
- **William Blair**: Samsung back in game with HBM4 mass production; expects to 3x HBM revenue in 2026
- **TD Cowen**: HBM driving premium margins; supports higher multiple thesis

### 3. Peak EPS Significantly Higher Than Street
- **RBC**: Sees **>$50 peak EPS potential** (vs $38 Street); modeling gross margins reaching 70%
- **TD Cowen**: Investors may start framing MU earnings power closer to **$50 EPS** driven by high-70s% gross margins exiting CY26
- **Wells Fargo**: Estimates FY26E EPS of $32.72, FY27E of $41.34

### 4. Long-Term Agreements (LTAs) Gaining Traction
- **RBC**: "Extreme tightness in Memory, sparking discussions about long-term agreements"
- **TD Cowen**: Odds of multi-year LTAs rising; would reduce earnings volatility and improve multiple
- **TD Cowen**: "This round of checks strongly supports suppliers' leverage in dictating terms"

### 5. Higher Multiple Justified
- **RBC**: Deserves structurally higher multiple due to non-commodity HBM mix (~30% of DRAM)
- **RBC**: PT of $425 based on 11x CY27 EPS (3.4x P/B) vs prior cycle peaks of 5-9x
- **TD Cowen**: PT of $450 based on 12x CY26E EPS
- **Wells Fargo**: Sees structural/secular support for multiple expansion (10x CY27 EPS or 15x on $25-30 through-cycle EPS)

## Report-Specific Key Insights

### RBC Capital Markets (Jan 14) - Initiation
**Core Thesis:** DRAM cycle has legs; HBM growth sustainable
- Cleanroom constraints persist until 2027; HBM trade ratio increasing (3:1 → 4:1)
- HBM supply including HBM4 **sold out through 2026**
- NAND benefiting from HDD tightness shifting demand to eSSDs
- **Bull case**: $500 (12x CY27E EPS) if HBM share grows above 20%
- **Bear case**: $200 (5x CY27E EPS) if HBM share loss or LTAs limit ASP upside

### Wells Fargo (Jan 19) - PSMC Acquisition
**Core Thesis:** Positive for disciplined capacity expansion
- PSMC P5 fab acquisition for $1.8B: ~120k wspm capacity across 3 fabs
- "Meaningful" DRAM output beginning H2 CY27
- Accelerates capacity by 3+ years vs building new fabs
- Also establishes long-term foundry relationship for HBM advanced packaging
- Taiwan represents ~65% of MU's DRAM production footprint

### TD Cowen (Jan 20) - Memory Tightness
**Core Thesis:** Shortages worsening; peak EPS pushed further out
- DRAM/NAND ASP increases could push memory as % of CSP CapEx up mid-teens pp
- Dell's base case: shortages lasting into H2 CY27; some customers preparing for CY28
- Server ASP Y/Y may peak at **200%** and stabilize there
- MU stock Y/Y has not peaked more than 3-6 months ahead of server ASP Y/Y peak
- Near-term momentum remains supportive; may flip to semicaps in H2 CY26

### William Blair (Jan 29) - Samsung/SK Hynix Results
**Core Thesis:** Memory supercycle in full force
- Samsung Q4: 40% sequential DRAM pricing growth; HBM4 mass production, shipping Feb
- SK Hynix Q4: Mid-20% sequential DRAM pricing; DDR5 module shipments up 50% QoQ
- Spot prices: DDR5 and DDR4 up **300%+** in Q4
- Korea memory chip exports hit record $12.6B in Dec (up from $7.4B YoY)
- Tariff threat (15% → 25% on Korea) highlights Micron's scarcity value as only US-based memory mfr

## Variant Views / Risks Flagged

### Competition
- Samsung back in HBM game; expects 3x HBM revenue in 2026
- SK Hynix maintaining leadership, majority allocation at NVIDIA for HBM4
- HBM4E competition intensifying (both Samsung and SK Hynix sampling custom base logic dies in H2 2026)

### Execution Risk
- Production constraints (wafer supply, cleanroom capacity) could limit near-term upside
- HBM4 qualification still ongoing at multiple customers

### Cyclicality Concern
- NAND oversupply risk if unexpected increase in supply or decrease in eSSD/DC demand
- Historical memory market volatility could reassert

## Analyst EPS Estimates

| Period | RBC | Wells Fargo | TD Cowen |
|--------|-----|-------------|----------|
| FY26E | $31.40 | $32.72 | ~$38 (Street) |
| FY27E | $38.95 | $41.34 | N/A |
| CY26E | $36.50 | ~$33 | ~$38 |
| Peak Potential | >$50 | $25-30 (through-cycle) | ~$50 |

## Decision-Oriented Questions

1. **Is the HBM4 qualification risk overstated?** MU says sold out through 2026 including HBM4, but execution still matters.

2. **How much upside remains if Street moves to $50 EPS?** At 10-12x multiple, that's $500-600 PT vs current ~$435.

3. **Should we be concerned about Samsung re-entering HBM?** SK Hynix commentary suggests there's more demand than anyone can supply.

4. **Does the PSMC acquisition change the capacity/margin calculus?** Accelerates timeline but adds integration risk.

5. **Is this the right time to add given stock has run?** TD Cowen notes stock typically doesn't peak until 3-6 months before ASP Y/Y peak.
