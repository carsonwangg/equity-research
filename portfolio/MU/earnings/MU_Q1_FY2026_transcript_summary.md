## CEO Sanjay Mehrotra Key Themes

### HBM Momentum
> "We have completed agreements on price and volume for our entire calendar 2026 HBM supply, including Micron's industry-leading HBM4."

> "We forecast an HBM TAM CAGR of approximately 40% through calendar 2028, from approximately $35 billion in 2025 to around $100 billion in 2028. This $100 billion HBM TAM milestone is now projected to arrive two years earlier than in our prior outlook."

### Supply Constraints
> "In the medium term, we are only able to meet about 50% to two-thirds of our demand from several key customers."

### Technology Leadership
> "Micron has led the industry for four consecutive technology nodes in DRAM and three nodes in NAND with progressively faster yield ramps in every node."

### LTA Contracts
> "We are making progress with customers in our multiyear contracts with specific commitments... These contracts that we are under discussions for are very different from prior LTAs. They have specific commitments in them and a much stronger contract structure."

## Key Strategic Updates

### HBM4 Progress
- Delivered samples to multiple customers
- Volume production ramp planned for calendar 2026
- Bandwidth >2TB/s per stack (60% faster than prior gen)
- 20% lower power than HBM3E 12-high

### 1-Gamma DRAM
- Will be majority of DRAM bit output in H2 2026
- Yield ramping ahead of record pace achieved on 1-beta
- 30% higher bit density, 20% lower power vs 1-beta

### CapEx Increase
- FY2026 CapEx raised to ~$20B (from $18B)
- Primarily supports HBM and 1-gamma supply

### US Manufacturing
- First Idaho fab: wafers by mid-2027 (pulled in from H2 2027)
- Second Idaho fab: construction 2026, operational 2028
- New York fab: groundbreaking early 2026, supply 2030+

## AI Internal Adoption
> "Over 80% of our professional workforce actively uses GenAI, with total usage up tenfold since last year. In manufacturing, integrating AI into yield and quality management has cut root cause identification time by half in some cases."

## Market Outlook

- Server unit demand: high teens % growth for 2025 (up from 10%)
- PC unit sales: high single-digit % growth for 2025
- CY2026 DRAM & NAND bit shipment growth: ~20% (supply constrained)
