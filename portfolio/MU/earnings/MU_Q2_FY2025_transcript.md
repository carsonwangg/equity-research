## CEO Commentary (Sanjay Mehrotra)

### HBM Leadership
> "HBM revenue grew more than 50% sequentially to a new milestone of over $1 billion of quarterly revenue. Our HBM shipments were ahead of our plans, demonstrating strong execution of our ongoing ramp."

> "Micron's industry-leading HBM3E delivers a 30% power reduction compared to the competition. And our HBM3E 12-high has a remarkable 20% power advantage over competing 8-high products while providing a 50% higher memory capacity."

### Data Center Momentum
> "Data center DRAM revenue reached a new record. The combination of our revenue from high-capacity DRAM modules and our industry-leading LPDRAM for the data center also exceeded the $1 billion milestone for the quarter."

> "Micron remains the only company in the world to ship low-power DRAM into the data center in high volume, showcasing our pioneering innovation."

### Technology Leadership
> "Micron's 1-gamma is our first DRAM node incorporating EUV, and we have achieved 20% lower power, 15% better performance, and over 30% improvement in bit density compared to our 1-beta DRAM."

### HBM Market Outlook
> "We have once again increased our HBM TAM estimate for calendar 2025 to over $35 billion. We remain on track to reach HBM share similar to our overall DRAM supply share on a run rate basis in calendar Q4 2025."

> "As we said before, Micron has sold out of our HBM output in calendar 2025. We are seeing strong demand for our HBM supply in 2026."
