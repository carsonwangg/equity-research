## Key Quotes

**Sanjay Mehrotra:**
> "As AI drives unprecedented demand for high-performance memory and storage, Micron is exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on this transformative era."

> "We have deep relationships with practically every major customer of HBM and have earned their trust with our execution, delivering the world's lowest-power, highest-performance HBM."

**On D4/LP4 EOL:**
> "D4 revenues are low single-digit percent of our revenues in second half of fiscal 2025. We anticipate LP4 shortages may also increase as a result of EOL."
