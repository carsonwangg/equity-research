# **$GOOGL - ENHANCED EQUITY RESEARCH**

*Generated: February 4, 2026*

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**BUY** with $380 price target (15% upside) over 12 months. Full-stack AI positioning (infrastructure + models + distribution) creates durable competitive moat, though Cloud growth deceleration warrants monitoring. Risk-reward attractive at current valuation with margin expansion trajectory intact.

## FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS

**Recent Financial Metrics (Q4 2025)**
- Revenue: $96.47B (+11.8% YoY), in-line with estimates
- GAAP EPS: $2.15 vs $2.13 estimate (+1.2% beat)
- Operating margin: 32.1% (up from 27.5% YoY) — significant expansion
- FCF margin: 25.7% (up from 9.1% YoY)
- Operating profit: $30.97B (+1.7% beat)

**Segment Performance**
- Google Search: $54.03B (+1.2% beat) — core franchise resilient
- YouTube: $10.47B (+2.4% beat) — Shorts monetization improving
- Google Cloud: $11.96B (-1.8% miss vs $12.17B estimate) — deceleration concern
- Cloud Operating Profit: $2.09B (+5.9% beat) — margins improving despite revenue miss

**Peer Comparison**
| Metric | GOOGL | MSFT | META | AMZN |
|--------|-------|------|------|------|
| P/E (FY26E) | 22x | 32x | 24x | 38x |
| Revenue Growth | 12% | 15% | 22% | 11% |
| Operating Margin | 32% | 45% | 41% | 11% |
| FCF Yield | 4.2% | 2.8% | 3.5% | 2.1% |

GOOGL trades at a discount to MSFT despite comparable AI positioning, reflecting Cloud concerns.

**Scenario Analysis**
