# **$META - ENHANCED EQUITY RESEARCH**

*Generated: February 4, 2026*

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**BUY** with $850 price target (19% upside) over 12 months. AI-driven ad efficiency gains translating to revenue acceleration and market share gains. 2026 capex surge ($115-135B) creates near-term margin pressure but positions Meta as AI infrastructure leader. Risk-reward favorable given proven AI ROI and dominant social graph.
